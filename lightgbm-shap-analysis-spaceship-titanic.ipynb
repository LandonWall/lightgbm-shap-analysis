    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret complex gradient-boosted models, specifically LightGBM. The purpose is to make the results of these models more interpretable to both yourself and stakeholders. SHAP provides a unified framework to explain the output of any machine learning model, helping you understand the contribution of each feature to the predictions.\n",
